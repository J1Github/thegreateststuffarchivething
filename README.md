Patrick Star is a fictional character in the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. He is voiced by actor Bill Fagerbakke and was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. In addition to his supporting role on SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick also serves as the main protagonist of The Patrick Star Show, which premiered in 2021.

An overweight pink starfish, Patrick lives underneath a rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, right next door to Squidward Tentacles' moai. His most significant character traits are his laziness and low intelligence, although he occasionally shows that he is smarter than he seems. His ignorance often gets him and his best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants, into trouble. Patrick is unemployed and a self-proclaimed expert in the "art of doing nothing".
